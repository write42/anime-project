# anime-project
Keeping up with the seasonal releases of new anime is mentally exhausting. I want to look back on older anime to see what I might’ve missed or dropped when they came out. I also know that some of what’s popular may not match my taste. What I want to know from the data is:

* Which types are made the most?
* How do people rate what they watch?

Maybe in the future, I could create a recommender.
